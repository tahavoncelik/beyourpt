"Be Your PT" is a Fitness application developed using Flutter.

In the app, you can select your favorite exercises from the main exercise pool obtained through an API and add them to your custom workout routines by simply holding down on them. As a future planned feature, you'll be able to navigate to the Programs section, tap on the workout routine you have planned for the day, and record your weights during your training sessions. With regularly provided statistics from the app, you can stay motivated to increase your weights and enhance your performance. In essence, you can become your "Personal Trainer."
